A physical target remote control for Kahoot Games

## What is Kahoot?
Kahoot is this very cool tool to create quizzes and trivia for educational (or any other) purposes.  
Once the admin has setup all the questions, any player can just join the game and answer using a phone or any device that has a decent browser.

## What is Takahoot?
Well, we love Kahoot, we just thought that a phone was too "common" of a device to be fun. So we made a target and bought nerf guns to replace it and answer all the questions while shooting.  
Simple enough isn't it?
