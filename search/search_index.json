Kahoot is this very cool tool to create quizzes and trivia for educational (or any other) purposes. Once the admin has setup all the questions, any player can just join the game and answer using a phone or any device that has a decent browser. What is Takahoot? Well, we love Kahoot, we just thought that a phone was too \"common\" of a device to be fun. So we made a target and bought nerf guns to replace it and answer all the questions while shooting. Simple enough isn't it? Although this may seem easy , it actually means that we: * Conceived and Modelized every piece in 3D * Used 3D printers to print some of the parts * Used Laser-cutting machines to create the rest of the parts * Found and assembled the right electronics and sensors * Created an Arduino software + binary serial protocol to handle target-logic * Developed the main software UI to launch and control the games from your computer We are very proud of this project and hope it can be useful to create a more ludic way of learning. About this doc This documentation will allow you to get started on the use of your own takahoot devices. It also contains a Maker guide which will allow you to create your own device from scratch. Don't want to bother buying and printing / cutting materials? Contact-us and we will find a way to do that for you and send you the whole kits ready to assemble. Contributors A big Thanks to Takima who sponsored us and invested much time and efforts into helping to make this project a reality.

Although they work on different topics on a daily basis, they all like driving themselves beyond their comfort zone. Most developers are good at web programming, and we get better at doing large-scale architectures every day. The tradeoffs of this is that people get disconnected from the low-level universe. We love making stuff that blinks, interacts in reality, and that is not just software. Why? Because it requires a whole new approach (gravity, electronics hardware design, properties of materials, heat, sensitivity, inter-operability, etc...) and brings very interesting challenges we just don't see anywhere else. It also was a unique opportunity to really do it from scratch : from the 3D design to the making, assembly, driver, and client. The Sponsors A big Thanks to Takima who sponsored us and invested much time and efforts into helping to make this project a reality.

Assembling the board JST Sockets Take the PCB named Takahoot controller , grab the 6-pin JST sockets and insert them into their appropriate spots. Make sure the board is on the right side, as shown on picture! Solder it onto the board as shown (NB: notice again which side of the board we are soldering on). Arduino pins Power-Supply Take your Arduino Nano v3 (328P recommended) and use a bolt cutter to cut out the straight-pins : 1x 6-pins, 2x 1-pin Solder the pins on the same side of the JST Sockets. Now be careful and insert the Arduino Nano board. Make sure the pins are in the right hole and the board in the right direction! When you have double checked this, you can solder it carefully. At the same time, tin-plate each power-supply cable on both ends, and solder each cable to the board. Don't hesitate to put lots of solder as this will draw a few amps of current ;). Before you join your power-supply cables to the jack, make sure your jack bolt is on it. Otherwise, you may have to redo this step after feeling quite dumb (not that any of that happened to us... :D). If you use heat-shrink sleeves, now is also the moment to slip them in! Make sure you join them nicely, it is important for each end to be isolated from the other. If you did it right, it should look like this (notice the inner-part is the +VCC. GND is on the side-pin). Congratulations! Your board is finished! 2. Assembling the controller Before you assemble the controller, you need to break the build-pins which were essential for the 3D-Print to work, but useless for us. We forgot to tell you : we put some round magnets inside both the lid and the case. The magnets should be included in the kit :) (see BOM for more info). You can glue them easily in their socket. Once you're done, it should be like this! Now, just insert your controller board into the case, slip the power supply at the right position, and connect your USB Cable...

Assembling the controller"},{"location":"getting-started/","text":"Getting started Takahoot is a solution made of one or many physical targets behaving as kahoot sessions to answer a specific quizz using nerf or BB guns. There are 3 components you need to know about: * The Targets, which are split into 4 colored hit-zones and one control panel * Kahoot kahoot.com which is where you will design your Quizz and run it * The Takahoot Client, which allows you to use and configure the targets so that they can be used for your Quizz. Client Execute the latest binary release of Takahoot for your platform (Windows, Mac OSX or Linux). Binaries can be downloaded here . About the Control Panel Your control panel has one button, one knob, and three leds. The button The button is the calibration-button. Pushing it will launch a target-calibration cycle (for about 10 seconds). Do not touch your target while the calibration is ongoing. The knob The knob is used to adjust the sensitivity of your target. Turning it clockwise will make your target less sensitive to hits. The LEDs Your target LEDs are used to give you feedback on your hits and the state of your target. (R: red led, Y: yellow led, G: green led) RGY ON: target recognized by client RGY BLINKING: pairing started R ON: calibration in progress Y ON: waiting for a hit G ON: target hit NB: when a hit is detected on your target, it reaches the end of its cycle. That means that as long as you have not gone to the next question, only one hit ( = answer) will be accepted on the target. When players switch to the following question in the quizz, the targets are automatically reset to Y ON: waiting for a hit Setup In this example, we consider that you have 4 targets. Rest assured that Takahoot can be used with any number of targets (from 1 to as much as you want). Connect your 4 targets to a USB hub on your computer TODO: Photo of the USB Hub with the targets Run the Kahoot client and configure targets Click on Configuration . You should see your targets (If they don't show up, make sure they are connected and recognized by your Operating System). Your targets will go through this process : 1. Initialization: the leads on the control panel of your targets should be ON 2. Pairing: select and assign each physical target to its equivalent in the software. You will know which target is currently being paired by seeing all three LEDs blinking (USBs don't have orders, there is no way for you to know which target is the one on the left or on the right if you don't go through this step). 3. Calibration: the Red LED should be on for about 10 seconds. Your targets will go through hardware-calibration. Do not touch your device during this process. 4. Sensitivity: you might have to manually adjust the sensitivity of each target. In order to do this, you can go in Test Mode and manually check that the targets respond according to your expectations. Playing the game Make sure you have configured your targets before playing a game. Go to the main game interface : configured targets should appear. Launch a kahoot session and get your game ID (a number) Paste the game id in the Client and start the game! Players should appear as active in the Kahoot Game session The game should start automatically and follow the Kahoot Quizz questions When the game is over, you can either stop the game and go back to the main menu, or start over the same game.

Assembling the target The Box The target box might already be assembled. If it's the case, you can go directly to the next part: LED Strip In this part, we will only consider the case of the target, as shown on picture. First thing to do is to glue the sides together. This should be easy if you use a dense glue. We recommend using Plexiglas glue gel, which will give you both a firm grip from the first second and a quick dry. After, find which will be the front and which will be the back of your target (as shown below). The center square hole (to connect the target) is not centered vertically. It is closer to the back of the target. If you got it right, you can now glue the top of the target, using the same Plexiglas glue. Be gentle and precise. Your box is almost ready. To make sure we can access the target content (for firmware upgrades or anything else), we thought it would be nice if it was screwless. Therefore, we gave you some very cool and powerful magnets. Glue one in each corner, making sure they are all pointing the same direction (we used a red marker to mark their direction to avoid any cruel mistakes here!). We used an Epoxy glue for that one. Once the magnets are glued to the box, we can do the same and glue the other magnet to the back. For that one, we used plain old plastic glue, were very \"generous\" on the quantity, and cut anything extra after it dried. Warning: Make sure you double-check which side you are gluing the back on, and the direction of each magnet. We don't want any surprises here! Congratulations, your box should be all set :) LED Strip Take each LED Strip and plate it with tin. Once done, cut out 3 wire-strips of 7-7.5cm long. Strip the ends and plate it with tin. Assemble each strip to the next one, make sure that the arrow goes the same direction! Cut one last wire-strip ~25cm long. Use your Crimping tool to make a 3-Dupont-female-pin on one end, and solder it to the first strip on the other end. You can then fix the LEDs on the target itself. Great job! Parts, Sensor PCB Take all the bolts and insert them in the 3D-printed supports. Sometimes, prints are so narrow that your plastic support wont let the bolt come in. This is where your soldering-iron might come handy. Be careful, heat the bolt slowly until it is perfectly in position. Then you can screw on the board using the M3 screws. Take the Piezo sensor and lock both wires inside their small PCB controller. Then easily screw it on the Piezo 3D-printed support You are now ready to fix the Piezo and its support on the white Plexiglas Hit-zone. Get the Silicon dampers and make sure you put the Hit-zone in the right direction. You are now ready to fix the Piezo and its support on the white Plexiglas Hit-zone. Fix them one by one like this: You are now ready to fix the Piezo and its support on the white Plexiglas Hit-zone. Now find a way to make each damper go through the frontend of the Target.
