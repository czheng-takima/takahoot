# About Us

## The Dev Team

Lo√Øc, Alex and Logan have been working together for years at Takima.
Although they work on different topics on a daily basis, they all like driving themselves beyond their comfort zone.  

Most developers are good at web programming, and we get better at doing large-scale architectures every day.

The tradeoffs of this is that people get disconnected from the low-level universe.

We love making stuff that blinks, interacts in reality, and that is not just software.

Why? Because it requires a whole new approach (gravity, electronics & hardware design, properties of materials, heat, sensitivity, inter-operability, etc...) and brings very interesting challenges we just don't see anywhere else.

It also was a unique opportunity to really do it from scratch : from the 3D design to the making, assembly, driver, and client.


## The Sponsors

A big Thanks to [Takima](https://www.takima.fr) who sponsored us and invested much time and efforts into helping to make this project a reality.  

They also took care of all the materials required for prototype design, fablab fees, and even 3D printing plastics.  

It is an awesome company, you should [look it up](https://www.takima.fr) and try to join us :)
